Description: Calculates phenological cycle and anomalies using a non-parametric
    approach applied to time series of vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data 
    or field measurements. The package implements basic and high-level functions for 
    manipulating vector data (numerical series) and raster data (satellite derived products).
    Processing of very large raster files is supported.
